**TWO POINTER METHOD**

First intilize two integer variables.

Point Vriable 1 to starting of the  string 

Point Variable 2 to Ending of the string

Now start swaping the characters of  string by using swap function ,swap(s[i],s[j]).Do this task until (i <= j).

In each iteration don't forget to increment the i and decrement j.

By the end of the while loop we will get a reverse string of the orinal string

**Time Complexity :**
O(N)

**Space Complexity :**
O(1)
